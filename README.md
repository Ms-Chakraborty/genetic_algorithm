# Nurse Scheduler

# Spreadsheet

## Two different spreadsheets

1st one will store the original value. (if any permanent changes are needed , the changes can be made here)

The second one will always copy all the data entries from the first one initially, can any temporary changes can be made here (if someone is not available for a particular week you can remove that nurse from being part of the schedule that week)

## Three rows in the spreadsheet

Employee id

Name

Specialization

## Specializations

**Pediatric Nurse**

**Infection control nurse**

**Trauma Nurse**

**Neonatal Nurse**

General

Other

# Algorithm

The user can choose the specialization of nurses preferred from most to least, as per requirements of that week

## Fitness value

The nurse of specialization of higher preferred specialization is added,  the fitness value increases more as compared to the other specialization

Hence the algo will try to schedule more hours of working for that nurses with the preferred specialization 

Algo should also keep in mind no nurse works for more than the maximum legal hours
